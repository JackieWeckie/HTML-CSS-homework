        <h3>ACT 1</h3>

        <h4>PROLOGUE</h4>

        <p>
            Two households, both alike in dignity,<br>
            In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,<br>
            From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,<br>
            Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.<br>
        </p>

        <p>
            From forth the fatal loins of these two foes<br>
            A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;<br>
            Whose misadventured piteous overthrows<br>
            Do with their death bury their parents' strife.<br>
        </p>

        <p>
            The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,<br>
            And the continuance of their parents' rage,<br>
            Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,<br>
            Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;<br>
            The which if you with patient ears attend,<br>
            What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.<br>
        </p>

        <h5>SCENE I. Verona. A public place.</h5>

        <p>Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet,<br> 
           armed with swords and bucklers<br>
        </p>

        <h6>SAMPSON</h6>

        <p>Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.</p>

        <p>No, for then we should be colliers.

        <h3><b>What Is HTML?</b></h3>

        <p><b>Hypertext Markup Language <em>(HTML)</em></b> is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications.</p>

        <p>Web browsers receive <em>HTML</em> documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents</p>
        <p>into multimedia web pages. <em>HTML</em> describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally</p>
        <p>included cues for the appearance of the document.</p>

        <p><em>HTML</em> elements are the building blocks of <em>HTML</em> pages. With <em>HTML</em> constructs, images and other objects</p>
        <p>such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create</p>
        <p>structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links,</p>
        <p>quotes and other items. <em>HTML</em> elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as</p>
        <p><b1>< img /></b1> and <b1>< input /></b1> directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as <b1>< p ></b1> surround and</p>
        <p>provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not</p>
        <p>display the <em>HTML</em> tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.</p>

        <div class="link"></div>

        <h4><b>Markup</b></h4>

        <p><em>HTML</em> markup consists of several key components, including those called tags (and their attributes),</p>
        <p>character-based data types, character references and entity references. <em>HTML</em> tags most commonly come in</p>
        <p>pairs like <b1>< h1 ></b1> and <b1>< /h1 ></b1>, although some represent empty elements and so are unpaired, for example</p>
        <p><b1>< img ></b1>. The first tag in such a pair is the start tag, and the second is the end tag (they are also called opening tags and closing tags)</p>

        <p>Another important component is the <em>HTML</em> document type declaration, which triggers standards mode</p>
        <p> rendering</p>

        <p>The following is an example of the classic "Hello, World!" program: </p>
